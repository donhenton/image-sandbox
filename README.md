# Image Sandbox

Playing around with images of d3 graphs, downloading and testing svg --> image
Part of this code is currently incorporated into my node app at http://donhenton-node.herokuapp.com/
under Apps --> Mailer Demonstrations. This code provides the svg --> image data, 
which was then mailed as an attachement.

## Index Page
Demonstrates the various parts of the image being pulled from svg --> Canvas --> Image

## Simg.html

### SVG demos
